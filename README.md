# Prerequisites

After cloning repository, you need to install these dependencies:
- NPM
- Playwright
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)

## Initialize The Project & install Playwright at the same time

Once you open your framework, initialize it as a node.js project & install playwright at the same time by doing the following command:

```bash
npm init playwright @latest
```

This will initialize your project with NPM as well as the latest version of playwright.
